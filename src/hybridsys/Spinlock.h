/**
 * @brief A lightweight Spinlock
 *
 * This Spinlock supports the concepts BasicLockable and Lockable and is
 * therefore usable with lock_guard. Use this if you are only locking
 * for a very short time. Locking is very efficient (contrary to mutex),
 * and waiting is implemented with busy waiting (also contrary to mutex).
 *
 * @todo Consider implement this using test-and-test-and-set protocol to reduce
 * performance cost in high contention situations
